# BOLO-JS

A fresh version (32x32) of the famous Bolo / Winbolo tank game. Opensource for anyone to modify. This version is based on NodeJS, Phaser3, MongoDB and can be released for Windows, MacOS, and Linux.

The idea with this project is to have community input and contributions. All game assets, both picture and audio, should closely resemble the original game.
